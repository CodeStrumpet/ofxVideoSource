PS3EYE Driver
========

Some driver like routines to connect and work with Sony PS3 EYE Camera.

The driver is using [libusb](https://github.com/libusbx/libusbx) to handle USB communications.

Most of the code was ported from Linux kernel source.

You can find example code for [Cinder](https://github.com/cinder/Cinder) and [openFrameworks](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks) in corresponding folders.
